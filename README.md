# Example API for HackYourFuture Angular class

To start the app, first `cd` to the folder where this readme is located. Then:
```
npm install -g gulp
npm install
gulp
node dist/server.js
```

This should result in something like:

```
Users API listening on port 3000
```

*!KEEP THIS TAB OPEN*

In your browser, go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

This should show an empty array `[]`.

Other methods, like POST and PATCH and DELETE can only be made from either [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) or from your Angular application.
